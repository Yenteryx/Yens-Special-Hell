# Yens-Special-Hell
A message spammer/autoclicker made with ahk with a very *interesting* name. Yes, this is actually a thing.
There's a few hotkeys just in case something messes up, you can restart the application, shut it down, and toggle the spamming through the hotkeys. The specific hotkeys are listed in the gui itself.
